# Error messages should be simple and easy to read
I have been developing my final year project in Go and I really appreciate the simple compiled error
messages that I get when I mess up some easy to fix syntax problems.

The reason why I say this is because error messages should be simple and easy to follow. I was
developing in node for the other unit group project as well and the stack traces that node throws at
you obscures the actual error which makes it harder and discourages developers to not want to
understand the error.

Just having one single line with along with the effected line does more than enough to understand
the compiled problem.
