# 2023 is here!
New day, new years. 2023 has arrived in the UK. Was nice as always to
see other countries celebrate their new years first before it hit the
UK. New years eve was gooood. United won and hololive event was pretty
sweet so it was enjoyable.

I feeel the buzz for when a new years hit. The anticipation. The hope
gives you the warm fuzzies. Insane to think how we are already turning
over a new year because it all feels so fast.

Idk about new years resolutions but I would say that I want 2023 to be
"Ambitious" Considering I am going to wrap up uni and am in the job
hunt. I want to be able to be ambitious with what I do this year. I want
to smash my assignments and totally rock the job application process.

Another sweet goal to hit would be trips to the cinema. Would be nice to
do that after covid.

I would also like to message more in the Manchester united fan discord.

Totally should organise more meet up with the people that I consider
close to me. Meeting up with Martin and Pat would be cool.

I'll write up a more detailed look back on 2022 today. Totally forgor to
do that tbh.
