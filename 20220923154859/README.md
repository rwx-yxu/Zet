# Grand tour is now kinda mid
Their new special just got released and it is mid. There doesn't
seem to be much happening in terms of the driving experience since
they are mostly driving on empty roads that is sometimes snowy.Their
trio dynamic is okay but they need things to work off of. It has been
like this for a while now. Shame really.
