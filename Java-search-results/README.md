# Java search results are confusing
Searching for anything Java related will show up so many variations it
can be frustrating because of how tool specific Java can.

What I mean by this is that just looking up something that should be
simple such as `Java Testing Junit` shows articles that have multiple
ways to do this. Are you in Gradle or maven? what about are you using
Eclipse or Intellij? better yet, if you are in Eclipse and use Gradle or
maven, there is a specific way to do it... Why cannot this be
straightforward? for testing, that should not be tool specific for a
programming language.

Coding is fundamentally text editing. It is helpful to get automatic
imports but it is not an enjoyable experience trying to learn all of the
ins and out of a specific IDE. What if I no longer can use Eclipse? All
that muscle memory knowing where settings are will have to be retrained.

I am gaining more appreciation with how simple Go is more and more as I
go back into Java. The testing package is part of the standard library
and even just looking stuff up is straightforward that isn't bound by
what IDE you are using...

Ultimately, I just want to look at text and edit it.
