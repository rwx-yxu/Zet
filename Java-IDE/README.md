# Java compatibility on IDEs are strange.
For our final year university project, we are encouraged to use Eclipse
with Java. I had an issue importing my university lab work into eclipse
because the compiler version did not match.

In our labs we are told to just change the Java version and all is
well... Well, not really.

It turns out that I also needed to change a setting called `Project
facet version` to the Java version of the project as well.

I am not sure if this is a strictly Eclipse thing but the error message
told to me wasn't useful in the slightest. Intellij might handle this
better but I do find it odd that you cannot easily find the Java version
of a project after searching around.
